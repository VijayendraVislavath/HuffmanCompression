# Huffman Coding Compression Tool

This is a simple C++ project that implements a basic file compression tool using Huffman Coding. The project demonstrates lossless compression, efficient use of trees, hashing, and bitwise operations.

## Features
- Compresses and decompresses text using Huffman Coding
- Shows Huffman codes for each character
- Demonstrates encoding and decoding

## How to Run
1. Compile: `g++ main.cpp -o huffman`
2. Run: `./huffman`
3. Enter the text you want to compress

## What I Learned
- Implemented trees and priority queues
- Used hashing for code mapping
- Understood time-space tradeoffs in compression
- Improved memory efficiency
